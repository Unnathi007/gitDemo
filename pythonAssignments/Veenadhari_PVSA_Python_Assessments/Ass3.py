# Task 3:
# --------------

# Write a program to read realestate.csv and insert all the records to excel file and the excel file should be todayâ€™s timestamp  ( Eg: 25_Nov_2022.xlsx )

# - write the separate test cases to check whether the 
# excel file is created or not,
# size of the file is greater than zero or not
# -write the test case whether the no. of records in realestate.csv and xlsx records are equal or not.
# -write the test case whether the count of columns in file and xlsx are equal  or not.
# - you can also add other required test cases if required
# -create a test suite with all the test cases


# Also  write a program to convert realestate.csv to the json file   ( dictionary of dictionaries )
