The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the only global international<br/> organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations.<br/> At its heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated<br/> and signed by the bulk of the worldâ€™s trading nations<br/> and ratified in their parliaments.<br/> The goal is to ensure that trade flows<br/> as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.

 The WTO also participates as observer in<br/> the work of several international organizations.<br/> In all, the WTO Secretariat maintains<br/> working relations with almost 200 international<br/> organisations in activities ranging from <br/>statistics, research, standard-setting, and technical <br/>assistance and training. Although the extent of such<br/> cooperation varies, coordination and <br/>coherence between the work of the WTO<br/> and that of other international organizations<br/> continues to evolve so as to assist Members<br/> in the operation of their economic policies.
