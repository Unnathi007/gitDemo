So it's Pakistan vs New Zealand in the final but there's still a game left in this tri-series. Tomorrow Bangladesh take on Pakistan. 
A game for both sides to try out a few things before the T20 World Cup. We will be there to bring all the action from that game.
 Until then it's a goodbye from all of us here.
