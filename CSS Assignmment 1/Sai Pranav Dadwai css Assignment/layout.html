    <p>England's prowess in white ball cricket is well documented since 2015 and they have defeated the World Champions just ahead of the WC. 
        This will be a shot in their arm. Australia were fielding a strong team but England despite being in a soup in the first half of the 
        first innings managed to stage a stellar comeback. Malan led the fight back and Ali joined him. Then Curran and others chipped in with
        some fine spells with the ball to defend 178. They had come from behind to win against Pakistan and now have humbled Australia. England
        have made their intentions clear.But Australia would know that they have come really close and in big games these little things will
         matter.</p>
