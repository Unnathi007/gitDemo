   <p id = "p2">TLet's recap what you accomplished. You've told your weather_bot to recognizer regular expressions. You created a trigger for weather and set its Trigger phrase to weather. Finally, you connected the weather trigger to the get_weather dialog.</p>
   <p id = "p3">This trigger tells your bot to look for the word weather in any incoming message. In most cases, regular expressions (regEx) are more complex, however, in this tutorial, the goal is to demonstrate how it works. To learn more about pattern matching and built in evaluations, see Adaptive expressions. If you'd like to learn more about improving a bot with natural language processing (NLP), see Natural language processing in Composer.</p>
