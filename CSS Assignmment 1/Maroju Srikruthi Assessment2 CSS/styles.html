<p id="first">The oldest classical British and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, and word dividers and terminal punctuation became common.

The hedera leaf (e.g. ☙) has also been used in the same way.</p>
