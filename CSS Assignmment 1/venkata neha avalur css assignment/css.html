        Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. 
        Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. 
        Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old.

        Blog, in full Web log or Weblog, online journal where an individual, group, or corporation presents a record of activities, thoughts, or beliefs. 
        Some blogs operate mainly as news filters, collecting various online sources and adding short comments and Internet links. Other blogs concentrate on presenting original material. In addition, many blogs provide a 
        forum to allow visitors to leave comments and interact with the publisher. 
        “To blog” is the act of composing material for a blog. Materials are largely written, but pictures, audio, and videos are important elements of many blogs. The “blogosphere” is the online universe of blogs.
