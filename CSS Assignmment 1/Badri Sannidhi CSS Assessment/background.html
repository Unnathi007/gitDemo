    HI
<div>
    I’ve been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man’s control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don’t see myself upon that list

But she said where d’you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I’m not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Oh I want something just like this
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Oh I want something just like this
Oh I want something just like this
    </div>
