<p id="p1">Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi, or Vinayaka Chaviti or 
    Ganeshotsav is a Hindu festival commemorating the birth of the Hindu god Ganesha. 
    The festival is marked with the installation of Ganesha's clay murtis privately in 
    homes and publicly on elaborate pandals</p>   
<p id="p2">Karthikeya was born to Lord Shiva. He is called Saravana because he was 
    born out of Saravana thataaka. He is called Karthikeya because he was fed milk 
    by the krithikkas. He is called Shanmukha because he has six faces. But his original 
    name was Subramanya. Sage Vishvamithra was the one who gave him the name in the naming 
    ceremony that followed after his birth.</p>  
<p id="p3">The great exponent of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is one of the most powerful 
    incarnations of Vishnu, the Godhead of the Hindu Trinity of deities. Of all the Vishnu 
    avatars he is the most popular, and perhaps of all Hindu gods the one closest to the heart 
    of the masses. Krishna was dark and extremely handsome.</p>
