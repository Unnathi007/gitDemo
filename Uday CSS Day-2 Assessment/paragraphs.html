    <p id="i1">Built for the dynamic enterprise, the CyberArk Identity Security Platform enables secure
        access for any identity — human or machine — to any resource or environment from anywhere,
        using any device</p>
    <p id="i2">When everything is transforming digitally – from your industry to the threats you face
        – you need access management solutions designed to outpace any security risks that challenge
        your ability to compete.</p>
    <p id="i3">Increased investment in traditional endpoint security has failed to reduce the number of successful
        attacks. Foundational endpoint privilege controls are needed to remove local admin rights, enforce
        least privilege, protect credentials and defend against ransomware.
    </p>
    <p style="color:blueviolet;">Secrets and other non-human credentials, which are used by all types of applications to access IT
        resources and digital supply chains, are increasingly targeted by cyberattackers and are at risk of being
        inadvertently exposed. With CyberArk, security teams can centrally secure credentials across application
        portfolios and DevOps pipelines
